  abstract = {Ecological integrity is a term often used to describe the state of ecosystems subjected to anthropogenic pressures. It is usually defined closely to the literal definition of integrity: being whole or unimpaired. Considering the deep changes our world is undergoing, we argue here for ecological indicators that are not restricted to naturalness targets. We propose a conceptual framework for so-called level-2 indicators of ecological integrity, that evaluate how the integrity of ecosystems is preserved given their naturalness context. We develop reference relationships between indicator and contextual variables and then assess how an ecosystem is doing, compared to others in similar contexts, by its distance to this reference. We explore two such relationships: the amount of aboveground phytomass an ecosystem stores in a given volume (biomass packing efficiency) and the mean patch size given the total habitat amount in the landscape (habitat connectivity). Using datasets at the national and worldwide scale, we show that these indicators are objective measures of ecological integrity that allow the comparison of plant stands and landscapes across different environmental and naturalness contexts. This framework provides a basis to evaluate if the state of an ecosystem is degrading and paves the way to a triage system prioritizing conservation and restoration actions.}

abstract = {Ecological economics was formally established in 1989 with the ambitious vision of developing a new economic paradigm embedding the social and economic systems in the biophysical world. Ecological economics had its roots in the biophysical understanding of economics that pioneers of the field Georgescu-Roegen (1971), Odum (1971), Daly (1977), Jansson (1984), Martinez-Alier (1987) and others developed while studying the thermodynamic bedrocks shared by natural and social systems. Subsequently, however, ecological economics has explicitly but controversially adopted a ‘big umbrella’ approach to methodological pluralism, focusing more on topics such as valuing nature and its functions rather than attempting to understand and quantify the biophysical roots of economic activities. Biophysical economics was established in response to these concerns, focusing more on developing analyses and models of the transformations of nature to generate wealth and approached mostly from an energy and material flows perspective. The present paper argues that to achieve its original vision ecological economics must return to its biophysical roots. Collaboration between the two fields will help the next generation of thinkers to address the socio-ecological challenges of the 21st century requiring an energy transformation called for by aspirations such as the Green New Deal and the UN Sustainable Development Goals.}

abstract = {Ecological economics has ontological foundations that inform it as a paradigm both biophysically and socially. It stands in strong opposition to mainstream thought on the operations of the economy and society. The core arguments deconstruct and oppose both growth and price-making market paradigms. However, in contradiction of these theoretical foundations, ecological economists can be found who call upon neoclassical economic theory as insightful, price-making and capitalist markets as socially justified means of allocation and economic growth as achieving progress and development. The more radical steady-state and post-growth/degrowth movements are shown to include confused and conflicted stances in relation to the mainstream hegemonic paradigms. Ecological economics personally challenges those trained in mainstream theory to move beyond their orthodox education and leave behind the flawed theories and concepts that contribute to supporting systems that create social, ecological and economic crises. This paper makes explicit the paradigmatic struggle of the past thirty years and the need to wipe away mainstream apologetics, pragmatic conformity and ill-conceived postmodern pluralism. It details the core paradigmatic conflict and specifies the alternative social ecological economic paradigm along with a new research agenda.}

abstract = {Hiring pollination services has become an important strategy to secure fruit set in many pollinator-dependent crops, especially in monocultures such as the Californian almond (Prunus dulcis) groves, where the European honeybee (Apis mellifera) is frequently deployed to compensate deficiencies in the natural provision of insect-mediated pollination. Such beekeeper-farmer cooperation has been the focus of many economic models, although it is only one in a variety of setups under which bees (wild and managed) contribute to agriculture. Based on a thorough literature review and on our own research, we generalize the basic model by Rucker et al. (2012) to describe farmer-beekeeper interactions as determined by diverse agro-ecological, institutional and socioeconomic conditions. The generalized model serves as an analytical framework to classify real world farmer-ecosystem-beekeeper interactions, to identify possible causes for a suboptimal crop pollination and to formulate informed policy recommendations.}

author = {Benjamin Dube},
abstract = {Ecological Economists disagree much about their field and its relationship to mainstream economics and to policy. One reason for these disagreements is that the field pursues multiple goals under the headings of “interdisciplinarity” and “transdisciplinarity.” At least four distinct goals may be pursued under these labels; brainstorming and borrowing for novel combinations of ideas, building new sub-disciplines at the juncture of existing disciples, bringing multiple fields into methodological and theoretical coherence, and involving science in solving social problems. The latter two draw the most controversy. Ecological Economists desire reforming Economics and other social sciences by integrating theories from ecology and physics, but there are multiple means of doing so. Likewise, many seek to create new ways for academic knowledge to be better utilized in public decision-making, but perspectives differ here as well. These represent fundamentally different axes of disagreement but are not always treated as such. Ecological Economics continues to contain a broad range of perspectives, some contradictory, for a rather small research community.}

abstract = {This paper addresses the history of ecological economic thought (EET) in the period between the 1880s and 1930s, with the aim to contribute to a better understanding of the early history of modern ecological economics, as well as to the current position of the discipline in relation to its values, goals, methods and contents. EET is defined as the ideas concerning the interlinkages between ecology and economics and described through the analysis of the flows and stocks of energy and matter, including their economic implications for the processes of social provisioning and cultural development. The diversity of EET is analyzed in terms of dissimilar positions mainly concerning energy as a determinant of cultural development and the normative aspects involving resource distribution, social ideals and policy-making. Social energetics is identified as a foundation of EET. These definitions are then used to argue for the formation of a scientific metaparadigm, falling short of a full-scale Kuhnian scientific paradigm. In addition, insights are drawn concerning paradigm formation in modern ecological economics and how this paradigm formation is related to the on-going debate among ecological economists on the benefits and limits of the adoption of a broad methodological pluralism.}
